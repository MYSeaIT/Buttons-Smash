# Project README

## Introduction
This project involves creating a web page with interactive buttons that trigger audio and visual effects upon clicking.

## Development Process
1. Started by creating the HTML file (index.html) and added the necessary structure, including SVG buttons and audio elements.

2. Developed the JavaScript functionality for each button in the script.js file. This includes adding event listeners to play audio and manipulate the SVG elements upon clicking.

3. Implemented the CSS to style the elements and provide visual effects.

## Encountered Errors and Resolutions
- Error: Audio files not playing upon button click
  Solution: Checked the file paths for the audio files and ensured they were correctly linked in the HTML file.

- Error: SVG elements not transforming upon click
  Solution: Checked the JavaScript code for manipulating SVG elements and updated the logic to ensure proper transformation on click.

## Project Functionalities Errors and Solutions
- Error: The "Liked" text not displaying after clicking the first button
  Solution: Modified the JavaScript code to correctly update the text content upon click.

- Error: SVG paths not changing color upon click
  Solution: Adjusted the JavaScript code to target and update the path styles correctly.

- Error: SVG elements not moving upon click
  Solution: Updated the JavaScript code to provide proper translation and opacity changes for the SVG elements upon clicking.
